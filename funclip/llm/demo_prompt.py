0
00:00:00,50 --> 00:00:02,10
Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles,
1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,990
This is Reading San Liu Jiu,
2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,990
The article I want to share with you today is from People's Daily,
3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,730
Why should we read more books?
4
00:00:10,90 --> 00:00:11,930
This is the best answer I've ever heard,
5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,190
People often ask,
6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,690
After reading so many books,
7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,250
Aren't we ultimately going to return to an ordinary city,
8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,410
Do ordinary work groups,
9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,670
Build an ordinary family,
10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,960
Why bother? What is the meaning of reading?
11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:30,80
Today I'll share with you the eight reasons recommended by People's Daily,
12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,875
Tell you why people should read more books?
13
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:38,725
One: Places where footsteps cannot measure, words can.
14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,540
Mr. Qian Zhongshu once said,
15
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,140
If you don't read books,
16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,400
Travel ten thousand miles,
17
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,695
You're just a postman.
18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,320
Beijing,
19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:47,980
Xi'an,
20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,200
Nanjing and Luoyang lack the nourishment of knowledge,
21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,565
They are just familiar names in the ears but strange places in the eyes.
22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,360
The Forbidden City, Mountain Resort, Dai Temple,
23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,920
Qufu Three Holes, with cultural illumination,
24
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,340
They are not specimens weathered by time.
25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,105
But lives that have lived for hundreds or thousands of years,
26
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,370
Without reading,
27
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,920
A postman is just scenery,
28
00:01:13,0 --> 00:01:13,835
Forgotten after a glance,
29
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,365
Even if you wear out your shoes, what's the use?
30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,380
Reading not only makes real travel more enriching,
31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,260
More importantly, it allows the spirit to break through the shackles of reality and the body,
32
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,985
To embark on a long journey of the soul.
33
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,930
I've heard such a saying,
34
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,190
No extraordinary ship,
35
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,430
Can be like a book,
36
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,595
To take us to the vast world,
37
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,685
Places you cannot reach, words have been there,
38
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,750
Life experiences you cannot have, Shu Qi,
39
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,595
Will bring you together.
40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,340
The books you've read will enrich,
41
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,940
Your heart,
42
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,855
Making the empty and monotonous world colorful.
43
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,690
The characters in those books will gently call out when you're deep in life's mire,
44
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,190
A gentle call,
45
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,270
With their dreams in their hearts,
46
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,950
Unpretentious stories,
47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,90
Inspire you to resist hardships,
48
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,525
Move forward bravely.
49
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:11,695
Two,
50
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,900
The meaning of reading is to make people humble, open-minded, not stubborn,
51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,35
Not biased.
52
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,935
People who read less are more likely to suffer.
53
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,400
The more you read,
54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,185
The more transparent a person becomes,
55
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,30
A Zhihu user once shared his story.
56
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,310
Once,
57
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,650
He had a quarrel with his partner,
58
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,505
He was so angry that he couldn't sleep for several nights in a row,
59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,880
Until he read a book about intimate relationships.
60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,920
There was an interpretation about marital relationships in the book,
61
00:02:42,80 --> 00:02:43,100
Which made him suddenly enlightened,
62
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,170
Suddenly understood many things, the anger dissipated,
63
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,410
The mood improved,
64
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,194
The whole person felt refreshed.
65
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,340
A person who doesn't read much has limited knowledge,
66
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,180
Inevitably restricted,
67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,495
As a result, they must be confined by the current world,
68
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,740
When encountering a little setback,
69
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,460
It's easy to be negative and pessimistic,
70
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,720
Depressed,
71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,765
Trapping yourself in emotions,
72
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,760
Only through reading can you see through the truth of life,
73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,140
Gain wisdom in dealing with people and matters,
74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,95
Make life better and better.
75
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,890
The Art of Living says,
76
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,30
People must read books from time to time,
77
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,915
Otherwise, they will become vulgar and decayed.
78
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,730
Swords and vulgar swords grow all over one's body. A person's backwardness and stubbornness,
79
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,205
Are caused by refusing to read.
80
00:03:33,10 --> 00:03:34,790
Only in the process of continuous reading,
81
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,970
Cultivating the mind and nature,
82
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,735
Can we break free from our vulgarity and stubbornness.
83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,720
In this world, no one's life,
84
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,540
Is without troubles,
85
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,455
Only reading is the best remedy.
86
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,185
Three,
87
00:03:49,40 --> 00:03:50,720
There may not be a golden house in books,
88
00:03:51,0 --> 00:03:52,595
But there will definitely be a better yourself.
